A small library application

The goal of this project is to be build a library application so as to practie orgarnizing Javascript code.
 To do this I will be using Object and Object Constructors in Javascript.



 Wow I'm finally done with the project.
 The most challenging part was getting to add a button that will toggle the status ofa book from true to false and vice versa.
